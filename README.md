# Calculator Layout Boss Challenge

Using what I've learnt about auto layout, stack views and setting constraints, create the following UI. 

## Portrait

## Landscape

This is a difficult challenge. I pass the challenge if i can create the vertical and horizontal stacks required for the layout. Once I've done that, I can also get extra credit if I figure out how to layout the small details.
